# Storage and File Systems in Linux

Understanding storage and file systems is crucial for effectively managing and navigating Linux systems. This blog post explores Linux storage concepts, file system types, management tools, and the File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS).

## Linux Storage Concepts

### Mass Storage Devices

- **Device References**: Mass storage devices are referenced in the `/dev` directory, such as `/dev/sda` and `/dev/sdb`.
- **Partitions**: Partitions on these devices, like `/dev/sda1` and `/dev/sdb1`, start numbering at 1.

### Disk Initialization Types

- **MBR (Master Boot Record)**: Limited to a 2TB partition size and a maximum of 4 partitions.
- **GPT (GUID Partition Table)**: Surpasses MBR in disk size and partition limits.
- **Software RAID**: For RAID configurations, use `fdisk` to set partitions to Linux RAID autodetect.

### Common Linux File System Types

- **ext2, ext3, ext4**: The Extended file systems, with `ext4` being the most modern.
- **XFS**: A high-performance 64-bit journaling file system.
- **Reiser4**: Efficient with small files and metadata-intensive tasks.

### Linux Storage Management Tools

- **lsblk**: Lists block devices, including SCSI devices with `lsblk --scsi`.
- **fdisk**: Disk partitioning tool.
- **mkfs**: Creates a file system, e.g., `mkfs.reiser4` for Reiser4.
- **mount**: Mounts a file system to a directory.

## The Linux File System Hierarchy

### Understanding the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

The FHS is a guideline for the directory structure of UNIX and Linux systems, organizing system files in standard directories.

#### Key Directories and Descriptions

- **`/` (Root Filesystem)**: The base of the file system hierarchy.
- **`/bin/`**: Contains essential binary command files.
- **`/boot/`**: Holds boot loader files, usually for GRUB.
- **`/dev/`**: Device files, including hardware and special files.
- **`/etc/`**: System-wide configuration files.
- **`/home/`**: User home directories.
- **`/lib/`**: Library files supporting system commands and services.
- **`/media/` vs. `/mnt/`**: Mount points for removable media and temporary file systems.
- **`/var/`**: Variable data files, such as logs and e-mails.
- **`/opt/`**: Optional application software packages.
- **`/sbin/`**: Essential system binaries.
- **`/srv/`**: Service data.
- **`/tmp/`**: Temporary files.
- **`/usr/`**: Secondary hierarchy for user data.
- **`/proc/`**: Virtual filesystem for process and kernel information.

#### FAQs

1. **`/media` vs. `/mnt`**: `/media` is used for removable media, while `/mnt` is a more generic mount point.
2. **`/bin` vs. `/sbin`**: `/bin` contains essential user command binaries, and `/sbin` is for system administration binaries.
3. **`/opt` vs. `/bin` and `/sbin`**: `/opt` is for add-on application software, not part of the base system like `/bin` and `/sbin`.

## Conclusion

The efficient management of storage and understanding of the Linux file system hierarchy are fundamental skills for Linux users. From handling mass storage devices to navigating the structured directories of FHS, these concepts form the backbone of Linux system administration.
