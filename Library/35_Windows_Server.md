## The Essence of a Server

Imagine a server as a restaurant kitchen that caters to numerous guests simultaneously, handling various orders efficiently. In contrast, a personal computer is like a home kitchen, equipped to meet the needs of a household but not designed for large-scale service. Essentially, a server is a computer system that provides services and data to multiple users or clients.
