# Navigating Threat Hunting with Security Onion

Threat hunting is a proactive approach in cybersecurity, essential for detecting hidden malicious activities. This post will differentiate between threat hunting and penetration testing, elucidate the primary objective of threat hunting, and discuss advocating for its implementation in a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment.

## Differentiating Between Threat Hunting and Penetration Testing

<br>

### Understanding the Distinct Roles

- **Threat Hunting**: This involves proactively searching within a network or system for hidden malicious activities that traditional security measures might miss. It's like being a detective looking for clues that indicate a security breach or compromise.
- **Penetration Testing (Pentesting)**: In contrast, pentesting is about testing a system's defenses by simulating cyberattacks. It aims to find and exploit weaknesses in a system's security before a real attacker does.

## Primary Objective of Threat Hunting

<br>

### The Core Goal in Proactive Security

- The primary objective of threat hunting is to actively and continuously search for, identify, and help mitigate signs of malicious activities (Indicators of Compromise, or IoCs) within an organization's networks and systems. It's about staying one step ahead of potential threats and preventing them before they can cause harm.

## Advocating for Threat Hunting in a SOC

<br>

### Making the Case for Proactive Cybersecurity Measures

- To advocate for initiating threat hunting activities in a fully functioning SOC, one effective approach is to compile a detailed report and presentation highlighting the benefits of threat hunting. This could include:
  - **Case Studies**: Using examples of previous attacks to demonstrate how threat hunting could have made a difference.
  - **Enhanced Security Posture**: Explaining how threat hunting can complement existing SOC functions by adding a layer of proactive defense.
  - **ROI**: Discussing the return on investment, including the potential cost savings from preventing major breaches.
