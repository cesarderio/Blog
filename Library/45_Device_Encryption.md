# Enhancing Security: Protecting Data at Rest with Device Encryption

In the digital world, the security of data, whether at rest or in transit, is paramount. This post delves into the understanding of data states and the critical role of encryption in safeguarding data, particularly data at rest, in alignment with the principles of the CIA triad.

### Examples of Data at Rest and Data in Transit

- **Data at Rest**:
  - Examples include files stored on a hard drive, data on a laptop, and documents saved on thumb or flash drives. It's data that is not actively moving from device to device or across a network.

- **Data in Transit**:
  - Refers to data that is actively moving from one location to another, such as during file transfers over the internet or when sending an email.

### How Encryption Protects Confidentiality and Integrity

- **Maintaining Confidentiality**:
  - Encryption ensures that sensitive data remains confidential. By transforming data into an unreadable format, it can only be accessed by authorized users possessing the correct decryption keys.

- **Preserving Integrity**:
  - While encryption primarily focuses on confidentiality, it also plays a role in maintaining data integrity. Encrypted data, when altered or tampered with, will not decrypt correctly, indicating potential integrity issues.
