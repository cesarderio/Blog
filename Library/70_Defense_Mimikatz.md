# Navigating "Pass the Hash" and Defense Strategies Against Mimikatz

Mimikatz is a powerful tool in the realm of cybersecurity, known for its ability to exploit Windows authentication mechanisms. This post explores the various credential-gathering techniques Mimikatz can perform and discusses effective defenses against such attacks.

## Credential-Gathering Techniques in Mimikatz

### Exploring Mimikatz's Capabilities

Mimikatz is capable of several credential-gathering techniques:

1. **Pass-the-Hash**: This technique involves using a user's hashed password to authenticate to a system or network resource without knowing the actual password. It exploits the way Windows authentication protocols handle hashed passwords.

2. **Pass-the-Ticket**: Mimikatz can exploit Kerberos authentication by using a user's Kerberos ticket to access resources. This bypasses the need for entering a password or hash, as the ticket itself grants access.

3. **Overpass-the-Hash**: This technique takes a user's hash and obtains a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) from the domain controller, effectively turning a hash into a full Kerberos ticket.

4. **Golden Tickets**: Mimikatz can create a Golden Ticket, which is a TGT for the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) with extended or non-expiring validity. This grants domain administrator-level access to an attacker.

5. **Silver Tickets**: These are service-specific Kerberos tickets that allow access to particular services on the network.

6. **Pass-the-Cache**: Similar to Pass-the-Ticket, but it uses cached login credentials on Unix-based systems.

### Implementing Effective Security Measures

1. **Change Admin Privileges**: Reducing the number of users with administrative privileges decreases the potential impact of a Mimikatz attack. By limiting these privileges, attackers have fewer opportunities to exploit high-level access rights.

2. **Change Caching Policy**: Adjusting policies to limit credential caching reduces the data available for Mimikatz to exploit. This includes limiting saved passwords and Kerberos tickets.

3. **Turn Off Debugging Privileges**: Restricting debugging privileges helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the system where credentials might be extracted.

4. **Increase Local Security Authority**: Strengthening the security of the Local Security Authority (LSA), which handles authentication in Windows, can prevent tools like Mimikatz from accessing crucial authentication data.
