# Delving into Forensics Investigation with Autopsy

Computer forensics and cybersecurity are integral components of modern digital investigations and security. This post aims to clarify the differences between these two fields and outlines the six stages of a computer forensics examination.

## Differences Between Computer Forensics and Cybersecurity

<br>

### Contrasting Roles and Approaches

- **Cybersecurity**: This field is primarily concerned with prevention, focusing on protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. It involves implementing security measures, monitoring networks, and preemptively identifying vulnerabilities to stop cyber attacks before they happen.

- **Computer Forensics**: On the other hand, computer forensics is reactive in nature. It typically comes into play after a security incident has occurred. It involves the systematic examination of digital media and networks to uncover evidence, understand the nature of cyber attacks, and often assists law enforcement with the legal aspects of such incidents. Itâ€™s like digital detective work, piecing together clues from cyber incidents.

### Methodical Approach to Digital Investigations

- **Readiness**: Preparing tools, techniques, and legal considerations before an incident occurs.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the situation to determine an appropriate response.
- **Collection**: Gathering digital evidence in a manner that preserves its integrity.
- **Analysis**: Examining collected data to uncover facts about the incident.
- **Presentation**: Compiling findings into a coherent format, often for legal or corporate use.
- **Review**: Assessing the effectiveness of the investigation and learning from the process for future cases.
