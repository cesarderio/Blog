## Windows Event Viewer: The Diagnostic Tool

The Event Viewer is another crucial Windows feature, providing detailed logs of system and application events. It's like the black box of your computer, recording everything from normal operations to errors and warnings.

### Understanding Event Logs

Event Viewer categorizes events into three levels:

- **Information**: Logs normal activity of applications.
- **Error**: Records occurrences of errors in applications.
- **Warning**: Indicates potential issues that could arise in applications.

These logs are invaluable for diagnosing issues, troubleshooting errors, and ensuring that your system runs smoothly. Additionally, the event IDs associated with each entry can be used to search for solutions online, making Event Viewer a powerful tool for resolving system problems.
