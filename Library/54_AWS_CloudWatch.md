### CloudWatch Events Explained to a Non-Technical Friend

- Think of CloudWatch Events as a vigilant overseer or a security guard in a mall, constantly monitoring various activities. It watches over the cloud environment and detects significant changes or events. When something important happens, it triggers alerts or predefined actions, much like a security guard responding to unusual activities on their surveillance system.
