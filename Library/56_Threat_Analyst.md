### Describing the Job to Non-Technical Family Members

- As a Cyber Threat Analyst, think of my job as being similar to a digital detective. My primary responsibilities include monitoring, researching, and analyzing potential threats or unusual activities within our company's network and data systems. This involves keeping an eye on everything from office computers and servers to various services we provide, ensuring the digital safety of both the company and end-users.

## PowerShell as an Effective Attack Vector

<br>

### Why PowerShell is Frequently Used in Cyber Attacks

- **Built into Windows Machines**: PowerShell is a powerful tool that comes pre-installed on Windows systems, allowing execution of complex commands and scripts.
- **Stealth Capabilities**: It can operate under the radar, often without logging user movements, attacks, or histories, making it a preferred tool for attackers.

### Strategies to Reduce the Risk of Attacks

- **Enabling PowerShell Logging**: Activating logging in PowerShell ensures that all activities are recorded. This record can be crucial for detecting and investigating suspicious activities.
- **Using Constrained Language Mode**: This mode restricts the set of commands that can be executed in PowerShell, making it more challenging for attackers to execute malicious scripts or commands.
