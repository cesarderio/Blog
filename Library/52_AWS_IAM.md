# Navigating Cloud Identity and Access Management with AWS

The field of Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) is crucial for maintaining secure and efficient cloud environments, particularly on platforms like AWS. This post delves into the critical lessons learned from the Capital One data breach, focusing on the attack methods, AWS misconfigurations that facilitated the breach, and AWS governance practices that could prevent such incidents.

## Analyzing the Capital One Data Breach

<br>

### Key Techniques Used in the Attack

- **Credentials**: The attacker executed obtained security credentials (*****-WAF-Role) to gain elevated access within the AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF).
- **List Buckets**: Utilizing the compromised credentials, the attacker listed files and folders (S3 buckets).
- **Download Data**: The attacker downloaded files accessible through the compromised credentials.

## Understanding AWS Misconfigurations in the Breach

<br>

### Critical Flaws that Enabled the Attack

- **AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) Misconfiguration**: The attacker exploited a misconfigured WAF.
- **Excessive IAM Role Permissions**: The IAM role in question had overly broad access privileges, allowing unauthorized access to S3 buckets.
- **Improper Use of AWS Temporary Access/Login Service**: The attacker leveraged this service to gain access and request higher permissions/roles.

## AWS Governance Practices to Prevent Similar Attacks

<br>

### Implementing Robust Security Measures

- **Use of Monitoring and Automation Services**: Employ AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and Lambda services to review actions taken on S3 resources and automate security responses.
- **Role Segregation**: Assign individual IAM roles for each application, EC2 instance, or autoscaling group, avoiding role sharing across unrelated applications.
- **Scoped Role Permissions**: Limit the permissions of each IAM role to access only the necessary AWS resources. For instance, the “WAF” role in the breach did not require the ability to list S3 buckets for regular operations.
