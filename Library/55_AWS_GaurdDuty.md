# Navigating Cloud Detective Controls with Amazon GuardDuty

Understanding cloud detective controls is crucial in the field of cybersecurity, particularly in cloud environments like AWS. This post focuses on Amazon GuardDuty, a powerful tool in AWS for detecting and protecting against cyber threats. We'll explore the types of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) GuardDuty can detect, its data sources, and how it uses access behavior analysis to identify potential malicious activity.

## Indicators of Compromise Detected by GuardDuty

<br>

### Key Threats Identified by GuardDuty

- **Odd API Calls**: Detects unusual patterns or locations of API calls, indicating potential unauthorized access.
- **Scanning Attempts**: Identifies scanning activities aimed at discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Malware Connections**: Recognizes instances communicating with servers known for malware distribution.
- **Attack Attempts**: Monitors for attempts to exploit open ports or brute force attacks.
- **Unusual IAM User Behavior**: Alerts on deviations from typical user behavior patterns, which could indicate compromised accounts.
- **Data Leaks**: Detects abnormal data movement activities that could suggest data exfiltration.
- **Unexpected Infrastructure Changes**: Observes and alerts on uncharacteristic changes made within the AWS environment.

### How GuardDuty Gathers Information

- **AWS CloudTrail Event Logs**: Uses logs of API calls within AWS to identify unusual or unauthorized activities.
- **DNS Logs**: Analyzes DNS query logs for signs of malicious activity or unauthorized domain access.
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Examines network traffic data to detect abnormal patterns or communications with known malicious IP addresses.

### Leveraging Access Behavior Analysis

- GuardDuty employs machine learning algorithms to establish a baseline of normal user and system behavior within the AWS environment. It then continuously monitors for and alerts on any activities that deviate from this established norm, potentially indicating malicious intent or compromised accounts.
