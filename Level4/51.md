# Unpacking Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

In the field of cybersecurity, understanding the nuances of Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) is essential. This post explores the differences between IDS/IPS and firewalls, the scenarios for choosing network-based IDS over host-based IDS, and the major drawbacks of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS).

## Key Differences Between Firewalls and IDS

<br>

### Distinctive Functions in Network Security

- **Traffic Control vs. Monitoring**: While firewalls control and regulate network traffic, IDSs are designed to monitor and observe it, identifying potential threats.
- **Active vs. Passive Systems**: Firewalls actively block or allow traffic, acting as gatekeepers. In contrast, IDSs are passive systems, primarily alerting IT or SOC teams about potential threats without taking direct action to prevent or mitigate them.

## Deciding Between Network-Based and Host-Based IDS

<br>

### Situations Favoring Network-Based IDS

- **Network Traffic Monitoring**: Opt for a network-based IDS when the objective is to monitor all traffic across the network.
- **Multiple Device Management**: Network-based IDS is advantageous for overseeing multiple devices connected to the network.
- **Network-Level Actions**: If the goal is to monitor and initiate alerts at the network level, thereby reducing the need for interventions on individual devices, network-based IDS is preferable.

## Major Drawbacks of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)

<br>

### Challenges Associated with NIDS

- **Passive Nature**: NIDS do not actively intervene to stop or prevent threats, limiting their role to detection and alerting.
- **Expertise Requirement**: Operating and maintaining NIDS requires specialized knowledge and experience.
- **High Rate of False Positives**: Frequent false positives can complicate the data analysis process, potentially obscuring real threats and causing operational inefficiencies.
