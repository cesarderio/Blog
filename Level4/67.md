# Understanding SQL Injection and Mitigation with Burp Suite and WebGoat

SQL injection (SQLi) is a prevalent security vulnerability that can have significant implications for web applications. This post explores what SQL injection is, provides an example of how it can be exploited, and discusses methods to prevent such attacks.

## What is SQL Injection?

<br>

### Explaining SQLi in Simple Terms

- SQL injection is a cyber attack technique where an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in a web application's database interaction. It occurs when a website fails to validate or sanitize user inputs. In such cases, attackers can insert or "inject" malicious SQL statements into entry fields like login forms or URL parameters. These malicious inputs are then executed by the application's database, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious activities.

## Example of SQL Injection Exploitation

### How Hackers Could Utilize SQLi

- Imagine a login page where a user is supposed to enter a username and password. If the application doesn't properly sanitize user inputs, an attacker could input a specially crafted SQL command into the username or password field. For example, entering `admin'--` in the username field might trick the system into logging the attacker in as an admin without requiring a password, as the `--` comment symbol in SQL can cause the system to ignore the rest of the query (including the password check).

## Preventing SQL Injection Attacks

<br>

### Strategies to Secure Web Servers

- **Use of Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)**: This technique ensures that an attacker cannot change the intent of a query, even if SQL commands are inserted by the attacker.
- **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Implementing strict input validation can prevent malicious SQL code from being executed. This includes sanitizing inputs to neutralize any embedded SQL commands.
- **Limit Database Permissions**: Restricting database permissions minimizes the potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack.
- **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**: Deploying WAFs can help detect and block SQL injection attacks and other common web application threats.
