### Intercepting and Examining Web Traffic

- **Burp Suite** functions as an intermediary between a user's browser and the web servers it communicates with. This allows Burp Suite to intercept, inspect, and even modify the traffic flowing to and from the web application. It's akin to having a checkpoint where every message is read and recorded for detailed analysis. This capability is crucial for identifying security vulnerabilities within web applications.

### Manipulating and Resending Requests for Analysis

- The **Repeater** tool in Burp Suite allows users to take individual HTTP/S requests and modify them before resending them. This tool is particularly useful for testing how changes in requests affect the responses from the server. For instance, altering parameters or inputs can reveal how the server handles unexpected or malicious data, thus uncovering potential vulnerabilities.
