# The Unwavering Legacy of the Linksys WRT54GL Router in SOHO Networking

In the world of home and small office/home office (SOHO) networking, certain devices transcend their technical specifications to become icons. The Linksys WRT54GL router is one such device. This blog post explores the historical significance and enduring popularity of the WRT54GL, a testament to the impact of open-source software in the networking realm.

### The Fame of the Linksys WRT54GL

The WRT54GL router is not just a piece of hardware; it's a symbol of the open-source movement's triumph in networking technology. Its fame stems from its compatibility with open-source software, allowing users to customize and optimize their networking experience beyond the standard features.

#### Longevity in a Rapidly Evolving Market

Despite its age, the WRT54GL continues to be a popular choice for many. Its ease of use, combined with the flexibility offered by open-source software, makes it a reliable choice for both new and long-time users. Its enduring popularity is a testament to the timeless appeal of simplicity and functionality.

### Understanding the Name: WRT54GL

Each element of the router's name has a specific meaning:
- **WRT**: Wireless Router
- **54**: Maximum speed of 54 Mbps
- **G**: Referring to the 802.11g WiFi standard
- **L**: Signifying its use of Linux-based firmware

### Linksys: From Commercial Routers to Household Name

Before becoming synonymous with consumer routers, Linksys initially offered commercial routers and home networking kits. Their first consumer router was previewed in November 1999 at COMDEX, a major computer industry conference.

#### Bill Gates and the Naming of the “Router”

The term “router” was suggested by none other than Bill Gates. This nomenclature has since become a staple in the lexicon of home networking.

### Firmware Controversy and Customer Influence

The WRT54GL's history is marked by a significant moment when Cisco, the parent company of Linksys at the time, replaced the Linux-based firmware with VxWorks. This change sparked a customer backlash, underscoring the community's preference for Linux and leading Cisco to revert to a Linux-based system.

### Navigating FCC Regulations

The WRT54GL model notably remains unaffected by new FCC rules concerning the 5GHz band, as it operates exclusively on the 2.4GHz band. This exemption further cements its place in the current market.

### Ongoing Support from Linksys

Despite its age, the WRT54GL continues to receive occasional updates from Linksys, ensuring its relevance and security in modern networking environments.

### Reflections and Future Inquiries

The story of the WRT54GL is not just about a piece of hardware; it's about how consumer demand and open-source software can shape technological development.
